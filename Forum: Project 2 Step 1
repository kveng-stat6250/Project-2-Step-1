[Research Question 1] Has the price of the house kept increasing or decreasing from 2010 to 2016 and at what rate? 
(Rational: This should help the investors to see how the housing market behave from 2010 to 2016.) 
[Note: This would involve taking the average of housing price quarterly or yearly.

[Research Question 2] What is the relationship between housing price and GDP?  
(Rational: This should help the investors understand the picture and the relaionship between GDP and housing price.)
[Note: This would involve merging two data sets one from macroeconomics data set and housing data set then we can make a table or a graph to see the relationship.]

[Research Question 3] What is the difference in housing price between the houses near metro area and the one further from the metro area?
(Rational: This should help the investors understand the housing price in different areas of the market.)
[Note: This would involve making either a frequency chart or table to show the housing price in different areas.

[Research Question 1] What are the top five districts that experienced the biggest increase in “Average House Price per square meter" between AY2014-15 and AY2015-16?
(Rationale: This should help identify districts to consider for investment having high percentage increase in Average House Price per meter to gain more profit.)
 [Note: This compares and combine the columns “price_doc” and “full_sq” from Test Housing Data to the column of the same name from Train Housing Data.]

[Research Question 2]
Can increase in Employment rate will be used to predict the “Average House Price per square meter”?
(Rationale: This would help inform the investors whether change in employment rate has any effect on Average House Price per square meter)
[Note: This required the columns “employment” from Macroeconomics Data and “price_doc” and “full_sq” from Test Housing Data and Train Housing Data.]
[Reason for Choice] 

[Research Question 3] 
Can increase in Average monthly salary will be used to predict the “Average House Price per square meter”?
(Rationale: This would help inform the investors whether increase in Average monthly salary has any effect on Average House Price per square meter)
[Note: This required the columns “salary” from Macroeconomics Data and “price_doc” and “full_sq” from Test Housing Data and Train Housing Data.]

[Reason for Choice] Housing costs demand a significant investment from both consumers and developers. 
As a data analyst our target is find the factors that are enough to make pricing predictions.
